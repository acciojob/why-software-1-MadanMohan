	<h1>Why I want to become a developer</h1>
	<p>During my childhood, computers were very rare and limited to certain offices and schools. I had great admiration for that machine
		but never got the opportunity to understand or be taught about it in detail. Later, when smartphones emerged with various 
		applications compared to simple phones, my fascination with digital technology grew even stronger. I was amazed when I discovered 
		applications like Facebook and YouTube — they seemed like absolute wonders. This experience sowed the seeds of my curiosity about technology.
		After enrolling in engineering, I finally got a personal computer and stable high-speed internet. I then decided to learn the nuts and
		bolts of development and AI. However, I wasn’t very successful at first due to a lack of planning and consistency. Still, the perseverance 
		in me continues to push forward, and I am determined to learn these technologies in depth and prepare myself to build some awesome applications.</p>
